# autogram
Autogram lets you streamline and automate content publishing legally via The Instagram Graph API.

By scaling, padding and converting content to meet Instagram's requirements, it takes all the hard work out of running an Instagram business profile. Simply drop your files into the *'pre-processing'* folder and select your post frequency and let autogram do the rest.

## BEFORE YOU START

**This is essential. If you skip this section, the application will not run.**

Before you can start using the application, the following steps ***must*** be completed as stated in the Instagram Graph API documentation.

||Getting Started |Links|
|---|------|---|
|`1.`|Create an Instagram **business** account. This **will not work** for other account types.|[Here](https://help.instagram.com/502981923235522 Instagram Business Account)|
|`2.`|Create a Facebook page & **connect it to your Instagram business account** via the Instagram mobile app. |[Here](https://help.instagram.com/399237934150902 Connecting Your Page)|
|`3.`|Apply for a Facebook developer account with the same Facebook account used to register the Facebook page in step 2. |[Here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/register/ Developer Account)|
|`4.`|Register a Facebook developer app, then give it [these](https://github.com/killianmcshane/autogram Permissions) permissions through the API Explorer Tool [here](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/ Explorer Tool). |[Here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app Developer App)|
|`5.`|Register an Imgur account, and an Imgur developer app through postman. |[Here](https://apidocs.imgur.com/ Imgur API)|
|`6.`|Enter your newly obtained details into the *defines.py* file. ||

The steps above can seem somewhat confusing. To help you complete them, I've made a quick tutorial below. I'd strongly recommend that you give it a watch.

## RUN APPLICATION
Simply drag all the files you want to upload into the *'pre-processing'* folder, run the command below.

> ```sh
> python main.py
> ```


Images, GIFs and videos will be automatically scaled, padded and converted to meet Instagram's specifications. Processed content will be moved to the *'uploads'* folder where they will automatically be uploaded to Instagram.

The default post frequency is set to every 4hrs however, you can easily update this by changing it at the top of the *main.py* file.
